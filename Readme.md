# yafootnote

`yafootnote` is yet another LaTeX `footnote` implementation with LuaTeX. 
It can be placed not only on main vertical lists but also on mimpage like boxes, namely mdframed and tcolorbox, and even within a plain old `footnote` command.

**NOTE** : This implementation is a sort of PoC status for now.
You can't expect it works in any practical LuaLaTeX documents.
It has still a lot of problems, especially when working with vsplited boxes, though it could be used practically within such boxes like a breakable tcolorbox.
